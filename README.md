The purpose of this lab was to construct a circular queue that took data (food packets), converting it from a food_pack data type to a food_type data type, then sent the food to different access points. We had to instantiate the queue at runtime with user input, making sure it was a generic with respect to its size. All of the code written in CircularQueue.adb, CircularQueue.ads was designed by me.
