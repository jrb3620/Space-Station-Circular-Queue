The purpose of this lab was to construct a circular queue that took data (food packets), converting it from a food_pack data type to a food_type data type, comparing that data for a end report that got printed at the end of the program, then I sent the food to different access points. We had to instantiate the queue at runtime with user input, making sure it was a generic with respect to its size. We also took user input for the number of product generators and POS. All of the code written in CircularQueue.adb, CircularQueue.ads was designed by me.
